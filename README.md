# Hello there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## 👨‍🦱 About me 

I'm an experienced NHS analyst with over 12 years of rich experience of working across acute, commissioning and arms-length bodies across the health and care sector. I am passionate about how analysis and modelling can be used to improve decision-making across healthcare. I am a mathematics graduate from the University of Manchester where I also completed my masters degree in Health Data Science. I currently work for the [NHS Transformation Unit](https://transformationunit.nhs.uk/) leading on a range of modelling and analytics projects, take a look at our [GitHub page](https://github.com/NHS-Transformation-Unit).

## 🔨 What I'm working on
 - **Statistical Analysis**: Using R to undertake analysis on a range of healthcare issues such as waiting times, demand and health inequalities. I enjoy using R to create interesting visualisations and methods for finding meaningful insights.
 - **Demand & Capacity Modelling**: Creating models to project demand for healthcare resources and determine the capacity required to deliver this. Example projects include modelling theatre capacity for elective recovery, determining winter escalation bed demand and modelling waiting times in Emergency Departments.
 - **Pathway Simulation**: Creating simulations of patient pathways to help understand bottlenecks and predict the impact of service re-design on waiting times and patient outcomes.
 - **Dashboard and Report Creation**: Creating dashboards using Shiny and interactive reports in RMarkdown to provide decision-makers with engaging analysis.

## 🌱 What I'm currently learning
- **Python**: Developing my understanding of Python for data analysis and for machine learning.
- **Julia**: Exploring how the high-performance of Julia can improve the analysis I create.

## 📫 Get in Touch
I'm always interested in connecting with fellow healthcare analysts, data scientists or enthusiasts. Please drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-wilson-6691a8172/)
